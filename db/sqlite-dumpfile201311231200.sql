The contribution of ISO Design Agency allowed the exhibition to take on a fantastical element.

A paper contributed by Jennifer Mundy and Jane Burton of Tate, note that project was started with the recognition that online exhibitions have an enormous, untapped potential for museums and curators to reach a large and genuinely diverse and global audience. They can be visited by anyone anywhere in the world at any time, offering a fantastic platform for the educational mission of museums. In terms of outreach,  they also reach remote and far off visitors who are less inclined to come to museums. They can also offer interesting ways to layer and present information (such as image, text, and interactivity) in the viewing experience. It also notes that digital technology allows viewing objects in high definition with more detail than what is available in galleries. 

Indeed, it was a great success in terms of visitor numbers, but the curators also noted that the exhibition was not taken as seriously by the art press – “a reflection of the difficulty that many in the art world have accepting the intellectual value of sites designed for mass audiences and which are associated in the minds of many with a sphere of popularising communications and transient promotion. This remains a powerful disincentive for further exploration or creative innovation in this field and needs to be addressed, we feel, if the potential of online exhibitions is to be realised and curators, scholars, and artists are to be involved.”

One of the project''s outcomes was to therefore to ask – “Can museums, both large and small, begin to welcome and exploit the opportunities afforded by online exhibitions? Can scholarly curators embrace the medium?”

The most impressive aspect seems to be, according to many reviews - the seamlessness it achieves. From the connection between the microsite application, audioguide, and the exhibition itself, between the many computers within the exhibition, it most convincingly demonstrates ''interfaces working in concert'' in our everyday lives through how they do so in the exhibition.

Furthermore, the viewer is able to enjoy the unique, evolving experience that is absorbing information from and interacting with devices. To understand the psychology of the experience is key to a lot of the aims of providing unique and impactful aesthetic experiences through digital means.
