      <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Digital Display Archive is a resource drawing from my ongoing research on how digital media and technology can create new environments for the curation, display, and dissemination of contemporary art. </p>
        <p>The projects featured have been chosen to exemplify a range of approaches and aesthetics. Including projects and initiatives by artists, arts institutions, curators, and the tech industry, it attempts to form an introduction and abridged history to recent experiments and innovation in this field. The aim is to present the diversity of ways of thinking about this subject.
        <p> Project description, information, and titles have been taken from their official press releases and presentations. I have written a short analysis to accompany each. The website is open for anyone to create an account and add information. </p>
